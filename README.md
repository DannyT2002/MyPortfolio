# My Portfolio Application
## Description

This portfolio showcases a developer's, AKA me, work and experience. Upon loading, you'll see the developer's name, photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and contact info. Navigation links enable scrolling to each section, with the work section displaying titled images of their applications. The first application's image is larger, and clicking on any application image redirects to the deployed app. The responsive design ensures optimal viewing on all devices and screen sizes.
